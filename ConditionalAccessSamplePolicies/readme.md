Conditional Access Sample Policies
-----------------------------------------------------
Instead of Microsoft365DSC, I decided to use Microsoft Graph PowerShell Scripts.
Because I find Microsoft365DSC too cumbersome in daily business.

In the **directory [M365x77476191.onmicrosoft.com-08-10-2023](https://github.com/philippkohn/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/tree/main/ConditionalAccessSamplePolicies/M365x77476191.onmicrosoft.com-08-10-2023)** there are example policies that are based on the Conditional Access Framework for Zero Trust Framework from "Microsoft - Claus Jespersen" and largely adhere to the guidelines.

⚠️ *Please test the Conditional Access Sample Policies in your Microsoft 365 Dev Environment before Production use!*
 
⚠️ *Please use a Break Glass Account - Don't shoot yourself in the foot* 

**With a few minor adjustments**
